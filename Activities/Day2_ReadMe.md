## Day 2 Activity File: Incident Analysis with Kibana


Today, you will use Kibana to analyze logs taken during the Red Team attack. As you analyze, you will use the data to develop ideas for new alerts that can improve your monitoring.

**Important**: Any time you use data in a dashboard to justify an answer, take a screenshot. You'll need these screenshots when you develop your presentation on Day 3 of this project.

:warning: **Heads Up**: To complete today's part of the project, you must complete steps 1-6 from the last class. Finding the flag isn't critical, but you want to get past the point of uploading the reverse shell script.

### Instructions

Even though you already know what you did to exploit the target, analyzing the logs is still valuable. It will teach you:
- What your attack looks like from a defender's perspective.

- How stealthy or detectable your tactics are.

- Which kinds of alarms and alerts SOC and IR professionals can set to spot attacks like yours while they occur, rather than after.


#### Adding Kibana Log Data

**Add an existing** to add the following existing reports:

- `HTTP status codes for the top queries [Packetbeat] ECS`
- `Top 10 HTTP requests [Packetbeat] ECS`
- `Network Traffic Between Hosts [Packetbeat Flows] ECS`
- `Top Hosts Creating Traffic [Packetbeat Flows] ECS`
- `Connections over time [Packetbeat Flows] ECS`
- `HTTP error codes [Packetbeat] ECS`
- `Errors vs successful transactions [Packetbeat] ECS`
- `HTTP Transactions [Packetbeat] ECS`

After creating your dashboard and becoming familiar with the search syntax, use these tools to answer the questions below:

1. Identify the offensive traffic.
   - Identify the traffic between your machine and the web machine:
     - When did the interaction occur?
     - What responses did the victim send back?
     - What data is concerning from the Blue Team perspective?

2. Find the request for the hidden directory.
   - In your attack, you found a secret folder. Let's look at that interaction between these two machines.
     - How many requests were made to this directory? At what time and from which IP address(es)?
     - Which files were requested? What information did they contain?
     - What kind of alarm would you set to detect this behavior in the future?
     - Identify at least one way to harden the vulnerable machine that would mitigate this attack.

3. Identify the brute force attack.
   - After identifying the hidden directory, you used Hydra to brute-force the target server. Answer the following questions:
     - Can you identify packets specifically from Hydra?
     - How many requests were made in the brute-force attack?
     - How many requests had the attacker made before discovering the correct password in this one?
     - What kind of alarm would you set to detect this behavior in the future and at what threshold(s)?
     - Identify at least one way to harden the vulnerable machine that would mitigate this attack.

4. Find the WebDav connection.
   - Use your dashboard to answer the following questions:
     - How many requests were made to this directory? 
     - Which file(s) were requested?
     - What kind of alarm would you set to detect such access in the future?
     - Identify at least one way to harden the vulnerable machine that would mitigate this attack.

5. Identify the reverse shell and meterpreter traffic.
   - To finish off the attack, you uploaded a PHP reverse shell and started a meterpreter shell session. Answer the following questions:
     - Can you identify traffic from the meterpreter session?
     - What kinds of alarms would you set to detect this behavior in the future?
     - Identify at least one way to harden the vulnerable machine that would mitigate this attack.
